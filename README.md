# Qatar-Restaurent-Project
The stakeholders of the restaurant have asked to develop a program where I had to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. The program should enable the logged-in user to place orders through the App. In responses to the Covid safety measures, the restaurant is offering the customers all possibilities of contactless placing orders.
